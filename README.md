*a dilettante if there ever was one, my thoughts rattle around in my head creating a tremendous racket.*

I'm a fourth-year student at the University of Virginia, double-majoring in Computer Science & Computer Engineering. My interests include computer graphics, simulation, and computer architecture on a low level i.e. hardware and operating systems. I'm currently working on Gizmo, a 16-bit CPU with a custom instruction set and a custom programming language.
